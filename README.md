# jira-sdk-php

This library uses [Jane PHP](https://github.com/janephp/janephp) to generate a PHP SDK for the [Jira Cloud REST API (v3)](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/) using the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification.

The structure of this library was inspired by the setup of [jolicode/slack-php-api](https://github.com/jolicode/slack-php-api).

## To Use

    composer require nhaynes/jira-sdk-php
